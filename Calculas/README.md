## Equation

Example:
```math
2x + 3y = 5
```

Here, 
    
    2, 3 & 5 are the constants and x & y are the variables.

- Here constants values are fixed and variables values are not fixed.

Other Examples:
```math
x^2 - 1 = 0
```
```math
2x -4 = 0
```
## Function

Example:
```math
y = 2x + 1
```
| x   | 1   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| y   | 2   | 5   |

Every function is a equation but every equation is not a function.

Input ➡️ x
Output ➡️ y

Funcation : If we put a value in a function then it will give a value.

Variable :-
1. Independent Variable
2. Dependent Variable

Here, x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable.

**Question 1 :** Is it a function which is given below?
```math 
y^2 = x
```
**Answer :** No, it is not a function because if we put a value in y then it will give two values of x.
