1. Determine whether the equation defines y as a function of x.


 1.1.
 
 ```math
    2x - 5y = 7
```

1.2.

```math
    (y + 3)^3 + 1 = 2x
```

1.3.
    
```math
        x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5
```

1.4.

```math
    2x - |y| = 0
```

Solution:

1.1. 

Here, we can write the equation as:

```math
    y = \frac{2x - 7}{5}
```
So, y is a function of x.

1.2.

Here, we can write the equation as:

```math
    y = \sqrt[3]{2x - 1} - 3
```
So, y is a function of x.

1.3.

Here, we can write the equation as:

```math
    y = \sqrt{5 - x^2} + 3
```
So, y is a function of x.

1.4.

Here, we can write the equation as:

```math
    y = \frac{2x}{|y|}
```
So, y is not a function of x.
