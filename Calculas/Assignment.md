1. Determine whether the equation defines y as a function of x.


 1.1.
 
 ```math
    2x - 5y = 7
```

1.2.

```math
    (y + 3)^3 + 1 = 2x
```

1.3.
    
```math
        x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5
```

1.4.

```math
    2x - |y| = 0
```

Solution:

1.1. Here, we can write y as a function of x as follows:

```math
    y = \frac{2x - 7}{5}
```
Now, Let's findout it's a function or not.

Let's take two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) such that x1 = x2 and y1 != y2.

Now, we have to check whether y1 = y2 or not.

Let's put x1 = x2 = 0 and y1 = 1 and y2 = 2.

```math
    y1 = \frac{2*0 - 7}{5} = -\frac{7}{5}
```

```math
    y2 = \frac{2*0 - 7}{5} = -\frac{7}{5}
```

So, y1 = y2.

Hence, it's a function.
