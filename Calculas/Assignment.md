1. Determine whether the equation defines y as a function of x.


 1.1.
 
 ```math
    2x - 5y = 7
```

1.2.

```math
    (y + 3)^3 + 1 = 2x
```

1.3.
    
```math
        x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5
```

1.4.

```math
    2x - |y| = 0
```

Solution:

1.1. Here, we can write y as a function of x as follows:

```math
    y = \frac{2x - 7}{5}
```
Now, Let's findout it's a function or not.

If we input in a function, we get only one output. So, let's check it.

```math
    x = 1 => y = -1
```
So, we get only one output. So, it's a function.


1.2 Here, we can write y as a function of x as follows:

```math
    y = \sqrt[3]{2x - 1} - 3
```
Now, Let's findout it's a function or not.

If we input in a function, we get only one output. So, let's check it.

```math
    x = 1 => y = -1
```
So, we get only one output. So, it's a function.
